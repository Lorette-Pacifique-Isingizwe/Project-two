            Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, 
            Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,

            Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
            Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.            
            It is our light, not our darkness            
            That most frightens us.            
            We ask ourselves            
            Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?             
            Actually, who are you not to be?     
            You are a child of God. 
            what my body knows
            is not a lie it’s not
            a lie i tell you it is not
            it’s nothing short of truth
            and nothing larger
            my past lodges
            in my marrow and if
            i wanted a transplant
            there’d be no match
            others’ sorrows dwarf
            my petty traumas still
            these bones are mine
            when they creak
            when they moan
            when they whine
            there’s only one thing
            i can claim these bones
            are mine i tell you
            they are mine and kind
            to abandon no thing
            that makes this pulse
            no one but me
           Tu m’as offert ta liberté,
        Je me suis livré à toi.
        Tu m’as donné ton coeur,
        Je t’ai ouvert le mien.
        Tu m’as offert ton corps,
        Je t’ai enlacé.
        Tu as dévoilé ton âme,
        je t’ai accueilli.
        Ton toi résonne en moi,
        Comme une partition de vie à écrire
        À quatre mains, à deux êtres, à tue-tête…
        Je t’aime !

            We ask ourselves            
            Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?             
            Actually, who are you not to be?     
            You are a child of God. 
            what my body knows
            is not a lie it’s not
            a lie i tell you it is not
            it’s nothing short of truth
            and nothing larger
            my past lodges
            in my marrow and if
            i wanted a transplant
            there’d be no match
            others’ sorrows dwarf
            my petty traumas still
            these bones are mine
            when they creak
            when they moan
            when they whine
            there’s only one thing
            i can claim these bones
            are mine i tell you
            they are mine and kind
            to abandon no thing
            that makes this pulse
            no one but me
           Tu m’as offert ta liberté,
        Je me suis livré à toi.
        Tu m’as donné ton coeur,
        Je t’ai ouvert le mien.
        Tu m’as offert ton corps,
        Je t’ai enlacé.
        Tu as dévoilé ton âme,
        je t’ai accueilli.
        Ton toi résonne en moi,
        Comme une partition de vie à écrire
        À quatre mains, à deux êtres, à tue-tête…
        Je t’aime !
